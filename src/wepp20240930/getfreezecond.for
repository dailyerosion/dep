      real function getFreezeCond(nowcrp,iplane)
c
c   +++PURPOSE+++
c
c   The following code determines the best frozen soil hydraulic coefficient to 
c   use based on the current land use. The three kfactors are read from the the
c   frost.txt file. kfactor(1) represents the frost permeability for forest conditions
c   (honeycomb frost). kfactor(2) for pasture/prennnial. kfactor(3) for annual crops
c   or fallow/bare (concrete frost).  3/30/2012 - jrf
