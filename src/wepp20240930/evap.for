c     Calculate the evaporation from bare soil.  First, compute the
c     amount of potential evaporation as if all the soil were bare
c     (EO); second, prorate EO by the fraction of soil that actually
c     is bare (EAJ) to estimate water demand (EOS); third, determine
c     how much water is actually available to satisfy this demand.
c     Calculations are performed using Ritchie's model.

c
c     Changes:
c             1) Common block UPDATE not used.  Dereferenced.
c             2) Include files PMXTLS.INC and PMXTIL.INC not
c                used.  Dereferenced.
c             3) Combined some equations like:
c                        ramm = ralb1 / xl
c                        eo = 1.28 * ramm * dlt / xx
c                        eo = eo / 1000.0
c                to look like:
c                        eo = 0.00128 * ralb1 * dlt / (xx * xl)
c                This resulted in some minor differences in rounding
c                in TEST-2.
c             4) Eliminated the following local variables:
c                RAMM, TK2, TK4, X1, X2, X3, X4, HC, ZM, ZH, ZOM,
c                ZOH, D1, K, EA, VPD, R1 & R2.
c             5) The line:
c                        hc = 0.5
c                was replaced with:
c                        hc = canhgt(iplane)
c                as per Reza's 8/27/92 instructions.
c             6) Local variable TMPVR1 was introduced to reduce
c                computations required.  To make it agree more
c                closely with the original results, it was made
c                double precision.
c             7) Removed RTO from evaporation calculations.
c             8) The last time the following equation appeared:
c                        tv(iplane)=(s2(iplane)/.0035)**2
c                it was incorrectly entered as:
c                        tv(iplane)=(s2(iplane)/3.5)**2
c                This was corrected following 9/2/92 conversation
c                with Reza Savabi.
c             9) In the following initialization:
c                        data esd/.10/,tv/10*0./,cej/-2.9e-5/
c                '10' was changed to the parameter that value
c                represented (MXPLAN):
c                        data esd/.10/,tv/mxplan*0./,cej/-2.9e-5/
c            10) Savabi changes to use rainfall interception added
c                7/30/93.   dcf
c
c            11) esd, cej replaced since they were constants; tv(mxplan)
c                added to cwater.inc  jca2  8/31/93
c
c            12) added ability to determine what et equation to use
c                depending on the iwind flag. sjl 10/2/93
c
c            13) changed cej value to -0.5 from -2.9e-5
c                in equation 7.2.3
c
c            14) variable eo (daily pet) placed in common block
c                cwater.inc and removed from local variable list
c                2/1/94  jca2
